## Introduction
Cryptocurrencies have gained significant attention in recent years, attracting both individual and institutional investors. However, investing in cryptocurrencies can be challanging due to their high volatility and the absence of traditional valuation models. This repository contains the code and analysis for my cryptocurrency analysis project. In this project, I utilized various statistical techniques and tools to analyze cryptocurrency data and gain insights.


## Project
The project focuses on analyzing cryptocurrency data to understand market trends, evaluate risk and returns, and optimize portfolio allocation strategies.

<b>Statistical Techniques :</b>
- Time Series Analysis : I employed time series analysis techniques to understand the patterns and trends in cryptocurrency data over time. This helped me in forecasting future price movements and identifying potential trading opportunities.
- Portfolio Optimization: I used portfolio optimization techniques to construct efficient portfolios of cryptocurrencies based on risk and return considerations. This involved determining optimal asset allocations that maximize returns while minimizing risks.
- Risk and Return Calculations: I performed risk and return calculations to evaluate the performance and volatility of different cryptocurrencies. This analysis helped in assessing the potential rewards and risks associated with investing in specific cryptocurrencies.
- Data Exploration: I conducted thorough data exploration to gain insights into the cryptocurrency market. This involved analyzing various aspects such as correlations, descriptive analysis such as skewnes and kurtosis, price movements, trading volume.


## Data 
The project requires historical price data for cryptocurrencies obtained from the Binance. The collected data should include historical price information for the following cryptocurrencies : Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Adacoin (ADA) with closing prices and timestamp.
