## Introduction
Cryptocurrencies have gained significant attention in recent years, attracting both individual and institutional investors. However, investing in cryptocurrencies can be challanging due to their high volatility and the absence of traditional valuation models. This project aims to address these challanges by providing a Python-based solution for portfolio optimization and time series forecasting.


## Features

* <b>Portfolio Optimization :</b> The project allows users to optimize their cryptocurrency portfolios by maximizing returns and minimizing risk. It incorporates modern portfolio theory concepts such as efficient frontiers, risk-return trade-offs, and diversification to create an optimal allocation strategy and also analyzing risk and return of historical cryptocurrencies prices.
* <b>Time Series Forecasting :</b> The project utilizes time series analysis techniques to study and model the behavior of cryptocurrency prices over time. It employes various algorithms such as ARIMA and SARIMA model, to analyze historical price data and extract meaningful insights.

## Data 

The project requires historical price data for cryptocurrencies obtained from the Binance. The collected data should include historical price information for the following cryptocurrencies : Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA) with closing prices and timestamp.
